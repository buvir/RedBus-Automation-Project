Redbus Bus Booking Automation Script

Project Description

This Python script leverages Selenium to automate a basic bus booking search on the Redbus website (https://www.redbus.in/). It navigates to the Redbus homepage, clicks on "APSRTC Buses," then selects a specific route (currently set to "Hyderabad to Vijayawada").

Important Note:

This script serves as a demonstration and cannot complete a full booking process due to Redbus's dynamic nature and potential CAPTCHAs.
Redbus's website structure can change, potentially affecting the script's functionality.
Requirements

<h1>RedBus Automation Project</h1>

<p>This project automates navigation on the <a href="https://www.redbus.in/" target="_blank">RedBus website</a> using Python and Selenium. It showcases the automation of selecting a bus route dynamically.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Automates navigation on the RedBus website.</li>
    <li>Demonstrates the use of Selenium for web automation.</li>
    <li>Handles dynamic web elements using explicit waits.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Demo</h2>
<p>Below is a conceptual representation of a British bus as a placeholder illustration:</p>

Python 3.x
Selenium (installation: pip install selenium)
ChromeDriver (download the appropriate version for your OS from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)
Place the ChromeDriver executable in your project directory or a directory accessible by your system PATH.
Installation

Clone this repository: git clone https://<your-github-username>/redbus-automation.git
Install required libraries: pip install -r requirements.txt (if you have a requirements.txt file)
Usage

Open a terminal in your project directory.
Run the script: python redbus_automation.py
Explanation

The script imports necessary libraries from Selenium and provides a time.sleep for demonstration purposes. It then:

Initializes a Chrome WebDriver instance.
Navigates to the Redbus homepage.
Maximizes the browser window (optional).
Uses WebDriverWait with EC.element_to_be_clickable to wait for specific elements to become clickable before interaction. This avoids potential errors if elements haven't loaded yet.
Performs clicks on the "APSRTC Buses" element and then the "Hyderabad to Vijayawada" route link (modify these XPaths for different searches).
Includes an exception handling block (try...except...finally) to catch potential errors during script execution.
Optionally closes the browser window at the end using driver.quit().
Customization

Modify the XPaths in clickable_option to target different routes.
Adapt the script for more complex booking interactions, but keep in mind Redbus's dynamic nature and potential limitations.
Additional Notes

Consider using environment variables for storing sensitive information (e.g., usernames, passwords) if needed for further automation.
Explore advanced Selenium techniques (e.g., handling forms, selecting options, dealing with CAPTCHAs) for more comprehensive automation.
Be aware of Redbus's terms of service and avoid practices that violate them.
